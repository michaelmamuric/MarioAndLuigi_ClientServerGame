Mario and Luigi Dash is a two-player game. The goal is simple: reach the finish line before your opponent.

This program was written in Java, and uses sockets and multithreading learned in the CPRG311: Advanced Object-Oriented Programming class at SAIT Polytechnic. This game also allows the two players to chat with each other before, during, and after the game.
